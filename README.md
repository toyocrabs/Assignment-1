-Valorant website
This is a website about the first person shooter game called Valorant.

The reason I chose Valorant as the subject of the website is mainly because it is a game I play regularly

The main purpose of the website is to serve as a short introduction to people who are new to the game/people who have not heard of the game before. The website is meant to look simple and just give a brief overview on the game. 

Thus, there are buttons on each section for vistors to click on to learn more about the game in detail on Valorant's official website. The navigation bar at the top of the website links to the different sections of the website.

This website is inspired by the official Valorant website: https://playvalorant.com/en-sg/
